# Artistry

## 💡 Inspiration

What makes a good content creator is one who knows what their audience is looking for. They're able to create something that their audience resonates with because their audience needs this type of information. We found that the most common challenges faced by content creators are aligning content with the buyer journey, creating buy-in among stakeholders, and understanding different buyer personas. We wanted to make a platform for creators to interact and sell their content securely and directly to their audience. So we created Artistry, an AI and Blockchain-based platform for content creators to share and sell their "content" to their audience in the form of NFTs. 

## 💻 What it does

Artistry is an AI and Blockchain-based platform for content creators to share and sell their "content" to their audience in the form of NFTs. We provide a feature where creators could generate images from the text for inspiration. We also added a recommendation engine so that it's easier for buyers to check out similar content. Artistry also has a chart room where the content creators can interact with their audience directly and also share thoughts with other creators with similar interests. 

On Artistry users can:
- Other users can buy their NFTs.
- Upload their creations in the form of NFTs.
- NFT recommendations according to your NFT purchase.
- Chatroom to interact with other users with similar interests.
- Running out of ideas? Try our AI-generated image page to take some inspiration.

## ⚙️ How we built it

- Frontend: React JS
- Backend: Python
- Blockchain: Solana
- Recommendation Engine: Deep Learning (Keras)
- Stable Diffusion: API (Hugging Face)

## 🤖 AI for Creators

Are you out of concepts? To find some inspiration for your next creation, visit our page for AI-generated images. You just need to type the art you wish to build and the ML model will generate some art for you which you can use or take some inspiration from. We have also used deep learning for the art recommendation system so that you can get the NFTs you like.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Building the recommendation system using a deep learning model was a bit hard but we made it happen in the end.
- Finding the datasets that we wanted was difficult, took a very long time to find it
- Building the front end and back end was a challenge for us.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Content creators can sell creations securely thanks to Blockchain
- Creators can also generate images with just simple text for their inspiration
- A recommendation engine for buyers to check out similar content
- A chat room where both the content creators and the audience can interact with each other

## 📖 What we learned

- This was our first project made with the help of Blockchain. We learned a completely new technology and were able to implement it successfully.
- We also learned to create a chatroom where a group of people can interact with each other at the same time.

## 🚀 What's next for Artistry

- Add support for more cryptocurrency transactions.
- Filter to NFT page.
- Content creators could create their content using Artistry instead of just being able to upload it.
